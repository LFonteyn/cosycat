* TO DO list:
** Backend
*** Systematic logging
*** Refactoring for production
*** Route notifications
Depending on whether the notification requires user response or not 
and whether the user is online or not: store notification in user
profile for later use (eventually emailing)

*** Blacklab
**** kill query on incoming query

** DB
*** Bulk inserts (does this work atomically in MongoDB?)
*** Notifications
**** Filter notifications according to stored profiles
Different notification profiles: 
- Debug mode (get all)
- Project mode (only project-related notifications)
- Followee relationships (get notified about followees actions)
- Don't disturb modus (get only obligatory notifications 
  but don't show them on top; store them in Updates)

*** Annotation categories database

**** Schemes

***** Simple
#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
    "pos": [
	"NN",
	"NNP",
	"PP"
    ],
    "animate": [
	"human",
	"non-human",
	"animal",
	"inanimate"
    ]
}
#+END_SRC

**** Or more complex, which of course implies more complex annotation schemes (including tag metadata)
#+BEGIN_SRC json
[
    {
	"key": "pos",
	"systems": [
	    {
		"name": "default Tagset",
		"source": "inline",
		"tags": [
		    "NN",
		    "NNP",
		    "PP"
		]
	    },
	    {
		"name": "STTS",
		"source": "http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/ressourcen/lexika/TagSets/stts-table.html"	
	    }
	]
    }
]
#+END_SRC

** Front end
*** Annotation page
**** Fix span annotations
**** DONE Retrieve textual context
**** Group annotation by colors
*** Query page
**** Warn/skip greedy quantifiers
**** Query on button click
*** Home page
**** Show connection status
*** WS
**** Reconnect on error
*** DB
**** Store user profile settings
**** Force Update of marked hits after new query? Or just remove marked hits after new query
**** Store user query history? or working with different queries simultaneously
