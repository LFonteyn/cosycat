* Cosycat (Collaborative Synchronized Corpus Annotation Tool)

** Introduction

 Cosycat is a web-based corpus query and annotation interface with a focus on
 multiuser *synchronization* and *version control*. The application is designed 
 with an emphasis on *modularity* and *reusability*.

*** What can you do with Cosycat

    The major goal of Cosycat is to enable synchronized multiuser annotation of corpora.
    While Cosycat can absolutely be used for annotating typical NLP resources (such as
    Part-of-Speech tagging a newspaper corpus), it is mostly geared towards (preferrably
    team-based) Corpus Linguistic research aiming at statistically analyzing 
    particular constructions that have to be first retrieved and annotated.

    Cosycat allows multiple users to analize 

*** How does it work

**** User interaction

**** Projects (access rights, pub/sub notifications)

**** VCS

**** Architecture

[[./doc/img/app-remote.jpg]]

** Installation

*** Clojure/Lein

*** MongoDb

*** Corpus Query Engines

*** Tagsets

**** BlackLab



** Contributing

*** Adding support for a new Corpus Query Engine

*** TODOs (WIP)

**** Bulk inserts (does this work atomically in MongoDB?)
   Span annotations always touch multiple documents (from B to O)
   In that case, we should try ~$isolated~:
   See [[https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/write-operations-atomicity/][atomicity]] and [[https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/update/isolated/#up._S_isolated][$isolated operator]].
