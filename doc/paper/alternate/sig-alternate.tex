  Current research in Corpus Linguistics and other related disciplines within the
  multi-disciplanary field of Digital Humanities, involves computer-aided manual processing
  of large text corpora. Typically, corpus instances are retrieved with the help of
  concoordancers or textual search engines and subsequently labeled by hand before being
  submitted to quantitative analysis.
  While well-established resources already cover the data retrieval aspect,
  less attention has been paid to the annotation process in terms of both software
  facilities and best practices. However, with the current increase in size and scope
  of research projects we envisage new needs for coordinating and managing interdependent
  analysis (meta-)data created being simultaneously created by different reasearchers.
  Current ad-hoc solutions typically involve general-purpose RTE (Real-Time Editing)
  software, whose functionality may be suboptimal for the present needs, as we shall argue.
  In the present paper we will discuss potential problems related to coordinating
  annotations in large-scale projects as well as the potential benefits that can be
  derived from an application-based approach to annotation data management.
  Furthermore, we discuss some of the design decisions that arise in the process of
  developing a principled solution.
  %% Furthermore, we sketch an application design as an attempt to provide a principled solution.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Current corpus-based research practices entail interacting with a single ground-truth
collection of documents \textemdash i.e. a corpus \textemdash, to which analysis metadata,
such as annotations, are added.

In a context in which the responsability for the design of the research is not shared
amongst several researchers, decisions as to how to create, design and manage annotation metadata are rather
unproblematic. However, with the current increase in size and scope of research projects in
the Digital Humanities?, we expect new issues to arise from the need for synchronization of
concurrent research activities which could otherwise lead to inconsistency in the annotation
metadata. In general, inconsistency may arise for reasons that are both intrinsic and
extrinsic to the proper research activity \textemdash i.e. having to do, respectively,
with interpretational disagreements as to the content and scope of annotations, and
problems related to concurrent modification of the annotation metadata by several researchers.
In particular, we are confronted with problems such as the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Unifying labeling conventions and tagging systems, which may not be available as closed
  set tagging systems prior to research or may subject to revision renegotiation.
\item In the presence of dynamic tag systems, not only procedures for introducing
  new label types and removing or modifying old label types have to be devised but also
  guarantees that these updates do not lead to a inconsistent tag system have to be provided.
\item Researchers annotating independently but within a shared framework of interrelated
  research questions need to be kept up to date of updates made by other researchers, since
  these have the potential of influencing or interfering with their own analyses.
\item Changes to existing annotations need to be back traceable and documented, providing
  a means for resetting to previous versions of the metadata and for logging the motivations
  that led to the change (in the form of change-logs, meta-discussions etc.).
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, a principled solution to collaborative corpus-based research is not only
desirable for the sake of the aforementioned problems, but it also provides a number of
associated advantages which have the potential to improve the quality of the research.
For instance, managing annotation metadata through a specialized application implies
having available these metadata in a unified and structured shape, which, without being
exhaustive, allows for the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Easy export and re-formatting functionality.
\item Storage of metadata in a database or indexing through a search engine.
\item Advance querying of the metadata.
\item Visualizing the metadata both as time snapshot and evolution over time.
\item Enable meta-research on research praticies thanks to the availability of structured
  metadata derived from the researcher activities (annotation updates, user behaviour, etc.).
\end{itemize}

Although to our knowledge no prior studies have addressed these issues both in terms of
established practices and available tools\footnote{
  [TODO: look for (tentative) studies in this direction.]
}, it can be assumed that a large part of current research requiring support for a
collaborative environment typically resorts to general-purpose Real-Time document Editing
(RTE) software\footnote{
  See, for instance, \cite{Rowlands2011} and \cite{Wood2011}, for examples of reports on
  using Google Docs for research.
}.
While these software solutions represent powerful and thoroughly tested tools, there are also
a number of drawbacks associated with their use in research.
For instance, their functionality may still be too general and overshoot the specific needs of
researchers, more specialized than those of common end-users. In particular, it is usually
cumbersome to cross-reference newly added annotations with the corpus positions and corpus
context in their scope.
Furthermore, the fact that data is managed in servers owned by the companies providing the
service may not always be compatible with legal constraints around corpus data.
Finally, RTE software solutions tend to prioritize user experience, which means that
responsive and non-blocking Graphic User Interfaces (GUIs) are privileged in detriment of
other features, such as support for document versioning, which stand in a direct trade-off
with user experience.

In the present paper we sketch an application-based approach addressing the aforemention
issues in a way that fits better the concrete needs of the practicioner.
More concretely, we propose to address the problem of managing concurrent annotation
metadata by multiple researchers in the terms of collaborative working systems.
Therefore, in sections \ref{subsec:rte} and \ref{subsec:vcs}, we will review two major and
not necessarily competing approaches to concurrent multi-user document editing
(Real-time document Editing systems and Version Control Systems).
Next, in section \ref{subsec:hybrid}, we argue that a hybrid approach may be better suit for
the issues established in the current section.
In section \ref{sec:case}, we describe the research infrastructure that we have implemented
following the design principles stated in section \ref{sec:cde}.
Finally, in section \ref{sec:future} we shall highlight lines of further research before
concluding in \ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Collaborative Editing}\label{sec:cde}
Collaborative editing refers to the practice by which dispersed
users are able to concurrently modify shared artifacts with the guarantee that changes
by different users will not overwrite each other \textemdash see also \cite{Altmanninger2009}.
Currently, collaborative software has become ubiquitous thanks to Web 2.0 services, such as
Google's web-based suite Google Docs \cite{Googlea} or
Microsoft's Office Online \cite{Microsoft}.

We note, however, that other approaches are available beyond the RTE framework. In
particular, Version Control Systems (VCS) \textemdash also known as Revision Control
Systems (RCS), or Source Code Manager (SCM) due to their popularity among software
developers \textemdash, represent a solution to collaborative editing that is often
overlooked due arguably to its less user-friendly nature and more complex document
updates procedures.

In general, RTE and VCS can be seen as alternative solutions to collaborative
editing \cite{Altmanninger2009}, differring with respect to, respectively, whether edit
operations are non-blocking synchronous operations, and immediatly reflected on the shared
data, or asynchronous \textemdash i.e. updates are first piped
through a working copy which is only sporadically merged with the source document.
In the next two sections (\ref{subsec:rte} and \ref{subsec:vcs}) we summarily describe RTE
and VCS systems.

\subsection{Real-Time document Editing}\label{subsec:rte}
RTE software system aim at solving the synchronous flavour of the collaborative editing
problem, which involves the following two-step procedure \cite{Imine2009}: first, local
changes are immeditaely reflected in the local copy of the document and, secondly,
the changes are propagated to other users across the network.
More concretely, RTE systems can be defined by the following characteristics \cite{Sun1998}:
(i) the user responsible for a change is able to observe it \textit{real-time};
(ii) collaboration is allowed to take place in a \textit{distributed} way across
different networks \textemdash which involves a layer of non-deterministic communication
latency; (iii) the system allows for \textit{unconstrained}, non-locking edit operations
\textemdash i.e. any user can edit the shared data at any time.

Thus, one major technical puzzle a RTE system has to solve consists of the fact that changes
are propragated across networks with different communication latencies and therefore do not
reach all end points in the same order. For example, given
the string ``efecte'' and concurrent edit operations \textit{Ins(2, ``f'')} \textemdash i.e.
insert character ``f'' at position 2 \textemdash and \textit{Del(5)} \textemdash i.e.
delete character ``e'' at position 5 \textemdash, the spell-corrected string ``effect''
can only be obtained if \textit{Del(5)} is executed before \textit{Ins(2, ``f'')}.

A common solution to consistency maintenance is Operational Transformation
(OT) \cite{SuClarence}, a technique that consists in a rule-based transformation
of edit operations which amends the position of an edit operation against a previous edit.
In the previous example, the edit sequence \textit{[Ins(2, ``f''), Del(5)]} should be
transformed as follows:
\begin{equation*}
  \textit{OT([Ins(2, ``f''), Del(5)])} \Rightarrow \textit{[Ins(2, ``f''), Del(6)]}
\end{equation*}
to ensure consistency with respect to the alternative edit sequence
\textit{[Del(5), Ins(2, ``f'')]}.

%% Three types of divergences:
%% Divergence
%% Causality Violation
%% Intention Violation

OT-based RTE systems work with linear data-structures, typically lists of characters, but it
is possible to work with list of elements at other levels, such as words, paragraphs or
XML nodes \cite{Imine2009,SuClarence}. For instance, in a RTE annotation application, one
might want to consider labels (annotation keys and values) instead of characters as the
atomic targets of edit operations.

%% Limitations...?

\subsection{Version Control System}\label{subsec:vcs}

VCSs have a large tradition originating in the 1970s as groupware for enabling collaborative
software development and more recently have become widely adopted as a result of
integration with a social network environment (GitHub, BitBucket).
Current VCSs follow the copy-modify-merge model, also known as ``optimistic'', to
collaborative document editing, in opposition to the ``pessimistic'' lock-modify-unlock model
in use among early VCSs such as SCCS, RCS or CVS \cite{Loeliger2012}.
In order to guarantee consistency maintenence the lock-modify-model forces users to first
acquire a lock for the target file and release it once changes are finished. However, 
the lock model proved to be too restrictive in practice.

The optimistic flavour of VCS represents an asynchronous collaboration model based on a
two-step procedure of local editing and merging with the shared document.

In principle, this two-step procedure resembles the one described in section \ref{subsec:rte}
for RTE systems. However, they essentially differ in that in VCS local changes are not merged
immediately (synchronously) into the shared document (as opposed to edit prograpagation
within the RTE framework); instead they are ``commited'' at a later stage
\textemdash i.e. asynchronously.
By separating edit and merge logic real-time responsiveness is
sacrified but in exchange two crucial features are gained: (i) the concept of a
\textit{working copy}, (ii) the fact that edits are meaningful \textemdash in the sense
that succesful merges can be deemed as intended \textit{versions} of the document.
We now turn to these aspects in more depth.

\paragraph*{Working copy}
A working copy is a local copy of the shared document that allows users
to modifying the document (in their local environment) despite parallel work by other users
\cite{Collins-Sussman}. The concept of working copy has the potential for VCS implementations
that are completely distributed \textemdash known as DVCS (Distributed Version Control Systems). %citation needed?
The general collaborative workflow with working copies can be described as folllows:
When a user wants to update the shared data to reflect the local changes in her working copy
(commits), a ``push'' operation is issued. Similarly, other users can update their local
working copies to reflect the current state of the shared data \textemdash an operation
known as ``pull'' in some implementations of this model.
In both cases a conflict between the local and shared copies may arise if (i) the shared
copy was successfully updated in a particular way by another user before the local changes
are pushed, (ii) or there have been local changes incompatible with the shared copy before
the latter is pulled.
VCS provides a merging mechanism to solve these potential version divergences known as
three-way merging, which involves all three document copies (both conflicting copies and their
shared ancestor) \cite{Altmanninger2009}. In general, VCSs provide automatic merging in cases
of ``syntactically'' unambiguous and it is commonly resorted to manual merging in cases
of ``semantic'' ambiguity, in which conflicting edit intentions may be present.%citation needed.

A crucial aspect of working copies is that they allow for more complex and flexible workflows
than the previously depicted case of a single working copy. In particular, users may create
multiple working copies, each of which can focus on a certain aspect of the project, and
delay merging to a later stage.
By this token, the workflow can be seen as a tree of branches (working copies
representing parallel versions of the shared data) that are being splitted and merged with
the trunk (the shared data).

\paragraph*{Versioning}
Versioning is a powerful feature for backtracking changes and restoring project state to a
previous one. Versions can be generally defined as the state of a document in a given time point.
In the context of VCSs, a version refers to the project state resulting from a successful merge.
Moreover, the asynchronous nature of VCS commits allows attaching metadata to commits before
merging. This is in opposition to RTE document updates that are triggered automatically
after any modification and propagated to other users.

Version metadata is useful beyond responsability traceability. More concretely, two aspects can
be highlighted: (i) edits to a document become meaningful allowing the author of the edit to
provide the motivations as well as to link to metadata in previous versions. While structuring of
the metadata is not enforced by default, it can be easily introduced by following particular
internal project conventions; (ii) tree-shaped edit history can be easily traversed back, choosing
which particular development branch should be followed, and therefore allowing for more specific
state restoration.

Moreover, as a consequence of the concept of working copies, project state can be again restored
to a certain version independently of concurrent actions by other users, allowing for parallel
versions of the same document. In fact, another popular feature of VCS implementations
is ``forking'' (creating a parallel version of the project, which may eventually be merged
again with the original trunk).

\begin{verbatim}
  {"word": "the", "pos": "AT"} \\ Brown Tagset
  {"word": "the", "pos": "DT"} \\ PTB Tagset
\end{verbatim}

%%                      _branch: brown->PTB     _ merge
%%                     /                         \
%% - user1 uses brown - continue adding more PTB  --

\subsection{Advantages of Asynchronous Collaboration for Corpus Annotations/Hybrid solution}
\label{subsec:hybrid}

RTE is conceptually simpler.
This conceptual simplicity, together with high GUI responsiveness, enables RTEs to provide a
better user experience.

We have highlighted the benefits of a VCS approach to data management in the context of
analysis metadata. However, it also has some drawbacks.
Given a sufficiently large corpus, researchers working in the same project can arguably be
expected to spend longer periods of time on non-overlapping parts of the corpus. Therefore,
commits will only result in conflicts with low probability - this allows to simulate more
RT interaction.

\section{Case Study?}\label{sec:case}

\subsection{Architecture}
Decoupling of the annotation application and the search engine. Enforce modularity.
Ideally, one should be able to swap backend search engines in a seamlessly way.

\subsubsection{Concoordancer}

\subsubsection{Annotation Database}
Data Model, refer to 

\subsubsection{Web-based Client}
Enabling real time interaction between users.

\subsection{Use Cases}
How our application addresses the problems specified in Section \ref{sec:intro}

\subsection{Limitations}
By decoupling annotation app from the backend search engine, we lose the power to incorporate
the body of on-going annotations.
While we acknowdlege this to be an important limitation of our current architecture, it need
also be pointed out that current corpus search engines are built around static corpus
representations, thus not allowing for incremental indexing of new metadata.

\section{Future Research}\label{sec:future}
Integration with other tools, being agnostic with respect to which search engine is used,
providing a simple API (only requirements are that the backend allows to retrieve data via
a communication protocol such as HTTP or RTC and that tokens are given an id corresponding
to their position in the corpus.
